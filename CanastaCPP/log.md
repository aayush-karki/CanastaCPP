- Played a games of online canasta from https://www.cardzmania.com/games/Canasta 
	to analysis how my class design would fit in the game ( 30 minutes ).

- Created a Visual studio project, started to code the game and set up source 
	control. Created the canasta class and the round class then populated them 
	with funciton declaration and member variables while following the class 
	designs. Also created a class files with class declaration for player class,
	card class, and deck class so that the program compiles (45 minutes).

	the class. ( 1 hour )

###### Total: 4 hours

## Sep 12, 2022:

- Changed the Card class constructor to accept only two parameter because the 
	point for the card and the type of the card depend on the rank and suit of
	the card ( 30 minutes ).

- Populating the deck class with its constructor and destructor. After
	researching for copy constructor decided to change the data structure 
	for m_stock and m_dealt to vector instead of stack. Copying stack as 
	it was had many steps and the benifit of stack--first in and first out-- was 
	was not worth the trouble ( 1 hour 30 minute ).

- Populating the deck class with its copy constructor and assignment 
	constructor. Researched deep copy and assignment constructor ( 1 hour ).
