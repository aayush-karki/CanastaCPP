# Canasta In C Plus Plus Log

## Sep 8, 2022:
- Read and tried to understand the cansata game rules, beanchmarks and other 
	guidelines ( 1.5 hours ).

###### Total: 1.5 hours

## Sep 9, 2022:
- Played multiple games of online canasta from the web to understand and 
	analyse the game. Used the site https://www.cardzmania.com/games/Canasta 
	to campare how its and ours rules differ ( 1 hour and 30 minutes ).

- Read the rubric that was uploaded to the course site and tried to 
	understand it ( 30 minutes ).

- Started a rough draft of class design for the project. Finished 
	the rough draft of card, and deck classes ( 45 minutes ).

###### Total: 2 hours and 45 minutes

## Sep 10, 2022:
- Drafted a rough design for hand class (30 minutes).

- Drafted a rough class design for player, human, and computer classes 
	( 1 hour and 15 minutes ).

- Drafted a rough design for round, and game classes ( 1 hour ).

###### Total: 2 hours and 45 minutes

## Sep 11, 2022:
- Cleaned the rough designed while cross checking with the guidelines 
	( 1 hour and 30 minutes ).

- Played a games of online canasta from https://www.cardzmania.com/games/Canasta 
	to analysis how my class design would fit in the game ( 30 minutes ).

- Created a Visual studio project, started to code the game and set up source 
	control. Created the canasta class and the round class then populated them 
	with funciton declaration and member variables while following the class 
	designs. Also created a class files with class declaration for player class,
	card class, and deck class so that the program compiles (45 minutes).

- Created a enum class called ENUM_CardType to indicate the different card type 
	in a deck ( 15 minutes ).

- Populated the card class with its member variables and member funciton. Tested
	the class. ( 1 hour )

###### Total: 4 hours

## Sep 12, 2022:

- Changed the Card class constructor to accept only two parameter because the 
	point for the card and the type of the card depend on the rank and suit of
	the card ( 30 minutes ).

- Populating the deck class with its constructor and destructor. After
	researching for copy constructor decided to change the data structure 
	for m_stock and m_dealt to vector instead of stack. Copying stack as 
	it was had many steps and the benifit of stack--first in and first out-- was 
	was not worth the trouble ( 1 hour 30 minute ).

- Populating the deck class with its copy constructor and assignment 
	constructor. Researched deep copy and assignment constructor 
	( 1 hour and 30 minutes).

- Populating the deck class with getter function created a Shuffel, DealCard,
	PrintDeck and Cosolidate function.
	( 1 hour ).

###### Total: 4 hours 30 minutes

## Sep 13, 2022:

- Designed an algorithm for Deck constructor when a m_stock is passed as string. 
	Created operator overload for Card Class ( 1 hours 30 minutes ).

- Tested and debugged the Card Class's overloaded operators. Fixed a lhs and 
	rhs mixup, and added a one more logical check for < operator ( 1 hour ).

- Created Deck constructor when m_stock is passed. Refined the design of its 
	algorithm, and tested it. Fixed the bug where the swapping was happening
	with the start of the deck insead of last as we deal the card from the 
	back of the m_stock list ( 2 hour ).

- Set up Hand and player class ( 15 minutes ). 

- Created hand's default constructor. Designed and created an algorithm for
	the hand constructor when a string is passed as hand and a string 
	is passed as melds. In the process created a card constructor that accepts 
	a rank and suit as a parameter ( 1 hour and 30 minutes ).

- Moved the constant rankList and suitList member variable of the Deck Class 
	to a struct name ST_ValidRankList in the "Card.h" file. Created its default
	constructor, and function to check if the passed rank, or suit, or rankSuit 
	is valid or not. in the process found a bug that was overlooked previously
	where the copy constructor was seted up incorred as a result of not testing
	the class properly ( 1 hour ).

- Researched exception handeling and how to make CustomException ( 1 hour ). 

###### Total: 8 hours 15 minutes

## Sep 18, 2022:

- In the process of hand's constructor when a string is passed as hand
	and a string is passed as melds found previously designed algorith to be
	insufficent. So redesigned and implement a new algorithm. Created a 
	PrintHand() funciton to print the hand ( 1 hour and 30 minutes ).

- Created copy contructor and destructor for the hand class ( 30 minutes ).

- Designed and implemented algorithm for aAddCardToMeld funciton. 
	Tested and debugged it ( 1 hour and 30 minutes ).

- Filled the Hand Class with the designed funciton definations and created 
	the declaration for inline functions ( 1 hour and 15 minutes ). 

- Changed the AddCardToMeld funciton to be more generic and made it into
	a private helper function. Designed and implemented AddNaturalCardToMeld(),
	AddWildCardToMeld(), AddRed3CardToMeld() ( 1 hour and 15 minutes )

- Designed, implement, tested and debugged MakeMeld() function. Adjusted 
	AddCardToMeld() funciton to be more generic by added more or conditions
	to its main if logic ( 1 hour ).

- Created TakeOutWildCard(), Discard(), SwaphandPos(), tallyPoints() functions.
	( 1 hour ).

- Finished the Hand class and did a final test and pushed to github 
	( 1 hour and 15 minutes )

###### Total: 8 hours 45 minutes

## Sep 18, 2022:

- Populated the header file of Player Class with member function defination 
	which were previously designed. Changed the parameters of all different 
	meld functions ( 1 hour ).

- Populated the header file of Player Class with member function declaration 
	( 1 hour ).

###### Total: 2 hours

## Sep 19, 2022:

- Changed the Cards class to now use the capitalized rank and suit ( 30 minutes ).

- Reworked the card's '<' relation operator. Tried to tweek the previously 
	designed algorithm to work with the new capitalized rank and suit, but 
	found a massive bug instead, so, decided to Redesign the algorith from 
	scrap. Implemented, and tested the new algorithm ( 2 hour ).

- Added input validation for hand class member function then removed the again as 
	I decided to valid the meldIdx and cardIdx as soon as users enters it
	( 30 minutes ).

- Finished the Player class by adding rest of the member funciton declaration.
	( 1 hour 30 minutes ).

- Tested the Player class ( 30 min ).

- Created new function in player class that allows access to hand's function. 
	Created EmptyHand function, while creating the function tried to figure
	out if there was a memory leak or not ( 1 hour 30 minutes ).

- Did final test for the Player class and pushed it to github ( 1 hour ).


###### Total: 6 hours 30 minutes


## Sep 23, 2022:

-  Populated the header file of Round Class with member function defination 
	which were previously designed ( 1 hour ).

###### Total: 1 hours 00 minute

## Sep 26, 2022:

-  Populated the header file of Round Class with inline member function 
	declaration ( 1 hour ).

- Populated the source file of Round Class with Constructor, destructor,
	copy constructor, assignment operator ( 1 hour ).

###### Total: 2 hours 00 minute

## Sep 27, 2022:

- Added emptyDiscard funciton ( 15 minutes ).

- Designed and implemented the print funciton for the round ( 30  minutes ).

- Redesigned and implemented the print funciton for the round ( 1 hour ).

- Implemented  the StartNewRound funciton researched methods to terminal
	screen clearing ( 45 minutes ).

###### Total: 2 hours 30 minutes

## Sep 28, 2022:

- started the main game class. Populated the header file of CanastaGame Class 
	with inline member function declaration ( 1 hour ).

- Populated the source file of Round Class with Constructor, destructor,
	copy constructor, assignment operator ( 45 minutes ).

- Designed and implemented the main Game logic and main menu funciton for the 
	game ( 1  hour 45 minutes ).

###### Total: 3 hours 30 minutes

## Oct 10, 2022:

- Did some bug fixing, fixed the input validation for the coin toss where capital
	letter were not accepted even when using to lower function. Turns out its
	code had std::tolower( userInput.at( 0 == 'h') ) instead of 
	std::tolower( userInput.at( 0 ) ) == 'h' for both head and tail 
	( 1 hour and 30 minutes ).

- Trying to fix another bug where two lines were printed to the screen. Narrowed 
	it down to something after the coin toss function is calling a card 
	constructor by sttepped through the card shows. But still have not figured 
	out what is calling it ( 1 hour )

###### Total: 2 hours 30 minutes


## Oct 11, 2022:

- Continued to fix where coin toss function is calling a card constructor
	by sttepped through the card shows. Managed to figure it out, it turns out
	was comaparing string with a char and my best guess for why would be that 
	the compiler was trying to be a good piece of software and was trying to 
	convert string into a card as the card has a compare function ( 1 hour ).

- trying to see what the best mehtod to let player choose what to do. In the 
	process added message vector in the round class ( 2 hour ).

###### Total: 4 hours 00 minutes

## Oct 12, 2022:

- Till now, the game was designed using the Model view controller principle, 
	but as this was the first time using that principle for a console app, 
	got confused and tried to replan how the logic of the game should be out 
	laid out. So looked into passed project and tried to anyaniz them 
	( 2 hours )

- moved the message to its own static class ( 15 minutes ).

- Designed and implemented the main menu logic ( 45 minutes ).

- Started working on the sub menu--menu which contains the save option that 
	is shown before the turn start. In the process started working on the player
	logic (  1 hour 30 minutes ). 

- Spend a lot of time to designing how the polymorphim  for the player class
	will work and how the computer will do its action ( 2 hours)

- Set up the computer and human class ( 30 minutes ) 

###### Total: 7 hours 00 minutes

## Oct 13, 2022:

- Refactor the canastagame code. Moved the save menu funciton to round class
	( 1 hour ).

- Decided to remove most of the while funciton to make the game more liner and 
	less confusing. Broke main menu function to controller and logic funciton
	and removed the while loop in it ( 1 hour 15 minutes ).

- Set up the FileAccess class for serialization and started populating it 
	( 2 hours )

- Designed and impelented the open file and create new file. 
	Iterated the open file and create new file couple of times to cover as 
	almost all of the edge cases ( 1 hour 15 minutes ).

- Researched the copy constructor and assignment operator for the FileAccess
	class, as the same file can only be opened once at a time. Ended up 
	using '= delete' on the copy constructor and assignment operator for 
	the FileAccess class ( 1 hour and 30 minutes ).

- Started filling the main menu class and started on the saveToFile and 
	loadFromFile funcition ( 1 hour and 30 minutes ).
